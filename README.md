# todoApp

This is a simple todoApp for my portforio. It has 6 areas, welcome board, today's tasks area, create tasks area,\
upcoming tasks area, done tasks area, and over tasks area. Discription of each area are as followed below.

## how to use it

## welcome board

This is just a greeting area. It doesn't have any function. Though it has two buttons, it doesn't work. `It's going to be fixed`
